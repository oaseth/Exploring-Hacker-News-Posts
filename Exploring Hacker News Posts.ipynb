    "Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") receive votes and comments. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data is approximately 20000. The data can be downloaded at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts).\n",
    "\n",
    "The description for the data columns are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Column** | **Description** |\n",
    "|:-----|:-----|\n",
    "| **id** | unique identifier from Hacker News for the post |\n",
    "| **title** | title of the post |\n",
    "| **url** | URL that the posts links to, if the post has a URL |\n",
    "| **num_points** | number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes |\n",
    "| **num_comments** | number of comments on the post |\n",
    "| **author** | username of the person who submitted the post |\n",
    "| **created_at** | date and time of the post's submission |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this analysis is on the part of the data which has titles beginning with `Ask HN` and `Show HN`. This analysis seeks to answer the following the questions:\n",
    "* Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` receive more comments on average?\n",
    "* Does the time of posts creation influence the number of comments on average?"
